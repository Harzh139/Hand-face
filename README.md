# ğŸ§  Face & Hand Detection with MediaPipe + Replicate SAM2

An interactive **Streamlit web app** that performs **face and hand detection** using **MediaPipe** and allows advanced segmentation with **SAM2** (Segment Anything Model) via the **Replicate API**.

---

## ğŸš€ How It Works

1. Upload an image using the Streamlit interface
2. MediaPipe detects:
   - Faces (bounding boxes)
   - Hands (landmarks)
3. (Optional) Detected face/hand regions are sent to **Replicate SAM2** for segmentation
4. Results are displayed and downloadable!
